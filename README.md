## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin

**Inside Claude Code chat (recommended - just 2 commands):**

Open Claude Code and run these commands in the chat:

```
/plugin marketplace add nyldn/claude-octopus
/plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
```

That's it! The plugin is automatically enabled and ready to use. Try `/claude-octopus:setup` to configure your AI providers.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting Installation</summary>

**If `/claude-octopus:setup` shows "Unknown skill":**

1. Verify the plugin is installed:
   ```
   /plugin list
   ```
   Look for `claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins` in the installed plugins list.

2. Try reinstalling:
   ```
   /plugin uninstall claude-octopus
   /plugin marketplace update nyldn-plugins
   /plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
   ```

3. Check for errors in debug logs (from terminal):
   ```bash
   tail -100 ~/.claude/debug/*.txt | grep -i "claude-octopus\|error"
   ```

4. Make sure you're on Claude Code v2.1.9 or later (from terminal):
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

</details>

### 2. Run Setup in Claude Code

After installing, run the setup command in Claude Code:
```
/claude-octopus:setup
```

This will:
- Auto-detect what's already installed
- Show you exactly what you need (you only need ONE provider!)
- Give you shell-specific instructions
- Verify your setup when done

**No terminal context switching needed** - Claude guides you through everything!

### 3. Use It Naturally

Just talk to Claude! Claude Octopus automatically activates when you need multi-AI collaboration:

**For research:**
> "Research microservices patterns and compare their trade-offs"

**For development:**
> "Build a REST API for user management with authentication"

**For code review:**
> "Review my authentication code for security issues"

**For adversarial testing:**
> "Use grapple to debate the best approach for session management"

Claude Octopus automatically detects which providers you have and uses them intelligently.

## Companion Skills

Extend Claude Octopus with official Claude Code skills for specific domains:

- 🧪 **Testing:** `webapp-testing` - Playwright automation
- 🛠️ **Customization:** `skill-creator` - Build custom workflows
- 🔌 **Integration:** `mcp-builder` - Connect external APIs
- 🎨 **Design:** `frontend-design`, `artifacts-builder`, `shadcn` - UI/UX tools
- 📄 **Documents:** `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx` - Office file handling

**How it works:** Skills are available to Claude (the orchestrator), not to spawned agents. Claude coordinates agents and applies skills before/after orchestration.

[📖 See all companion skills and examples →](docs/COMPANION-SKILLS.md)

---

## Workflow Skills

Claude Octopus auto-activates specialized workflows when you use certain phrases:

- 🔍 **Quick Code Review** - "review this code" → 2-5 min multi-agent review with quality gates
- 🔬 **Deep Research** - "research React state management" → 4-perspective parallel analysis
- 🛡️ **Adversarial Security** - "security audit" → Red team attack + blue team defense + remediation

These skills automatically trigger the right Octopus workflow (probe, grasp, tangle, squeeze) based on your request.

[📖 See all workflow skills and examples →](docs/WORKFLOW-SKILLS.md)


## Provider Installation (Reference)

The `/claude-octopus:setup` command auto-detects and guides you through this, but here's the reference if you need it:

**You only need ONE provider to get started** (not both!). Choose based on your preference:

### Option A: OpenAI Codex CLI (Best for code generation)
```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login  # OAuth recommended
# OR
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### Option B: Google Gemini CLI (Best for analysis)
```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini  # OAuth recommended
# OR
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIza..."  # Get from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
```

### Making API Keys Permanent

To make API keys available in every terminal session:

```bash
# For zsh (macOS default)
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash (Linux default)
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Check Your Setup

To verify everything is working, run in Claude Code:
```
/claude-octopus:setup
```

Or directly in terminal:
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh detect-providers
```

## How It Works

```
     DISCOVER         DEFINE         DEVELOP          DELIVER
     (probe)          (grasp)        (tangle)          (ink)

    \         /     \         /     \         /     \         /

        \ /             \ /             \ /             \ /

   Diverge then      Converge to      Diverge with     Converge to
    converge          problem          solutions        delivery
```

Claude Octopus detects your intent and automatically routes to the right workflow:

| When You Say... | It Routes To |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "Research...", "Explore...", "Investigate..." | **Probe** (Research phase) |
| "Build...", "Implement...", "Create..." | **Tangle + Ink** (Dev + Deliver) |
| "Review...", "Test...", "Validate..." | **Ink** (Quality check) |
| "Security audit...", "Red team..." | **Squeeze** (Security review) |
| "Debate...", "Use adversarial..." | **Grapple** (AI vs AI) |

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Advanced: Direct CLI Usage</strong></summary>

If you want to run Claude Octopus commands directly (outside of Claude Code):

### Core Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `auto <prompt>` | Smart routing - picks best workflow automatically |
| `embrace <prompt>` | Full 4-phase Double Diamond workflow |
| `probe <prompt>` | Research phase - parallel exploration |
| `tangle <prompt>` | Development phase - parallel implementation |

### Examples

```bash
# Smart auto-routing
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "build user authentication"

# Full Double Diamond workflow
./scripts/orchestrate.sh embrace "create user dashboard"

# Specific phases
./scripts/orchestrate.sh probe "research OAuth patterns"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh tangle "implement user login"

# Adversarial review
./scripts/orchestrate.sh grapple "implement JWT auth"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh squeeze "review login security"

# Configuration
./scripts/orchestrate.sh octopus-configure
./scripts/orchestrate.sh preflight
./scripts/orchestrate.sh status
```

**Common options:** `-n` (dry-run), `-v` (verbose), `-t 600` (timeout), `--cost-first`, `--quality-first`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔀 Provider-Aware Routing (v4.8)</strong></summary>

Claude Octopus intelligently routes tasks based on your subscription tiers and costs.

### CLI Flags

```bash
--provider <name>     # Force provider: codex, gemini, claude, openrouter
--cost-first          # Prefer cheapest capable provider
--quality-first       # Prefer highest-tier provider
--openrouter-nitro    # Use fastest OpenRouter routing
--openrouter-floor    # Use cheapest OpenRouter routing
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `balanced` (default) | Smart mix of cost and quality |
| `cost-first` | Prefer cheapest capable provider |
| `quality-first` | Prefer highest-tier provider |

### Provider Tiers

The configuration wizard sets your subscription tier for each provider:

| Provider | Tiers | Cost Behavior |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Codex/OpenAI | free, plus, pro, api-only | Routes based on tier |
| Gemini | free, google-one, workspace, api-only | Workspace = bundled (free) |
| Claude | pro, max-5x, max-20x, api-only | Conserves Opus for complex tasks |
| OpenRouter | pay-per-use | 400+ models as fallback |

**Example:** If you have Google Workspace (bundled Gemini), the system prefers Gemini for heavy analysis since it's "free" with your work account.

```bash
# Check current provider status
./scripts/orchestrate.sh status

# Force cost-first routing
./scripts/orchestrate.sh --cost-first auto "research best practices"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🤼 Crossfire: Adversarial Review (v4.7)</strong></summary>

Different AI models have different blind spots. Crossfire forces models to critique each other.

### Grapple - Adversarial Debate

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh grapple "implement password reset API"
./scripts/orchestrate.sh grapple --principles security "implement JWT auth"
```

**How it works:**
```
Round 1: Codex proposes → Gemini proposes (parallel)
Round 2: Gemini critiques Codex → Codex critiques Gemini
Round 3: Synthesis determines winner + final implementation
```

### Squeeze - Red Team Security Review

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh squeeze "implement user login form"
```

| Phase | Team | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Blue Team (Codex) | Implements secure solution |
| 2 | Red Team (Gemini) | Finds vulnerabilities |
| 3 | Remediation | Fixes all issues |
| 4 | Validation | Verifies all fixed |

### Constitutional Principles

| Principle | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| `general` | Overall quality (default) |
| `security` | OWASP Top 10, secure coding |
| `performance` | N+1 queries, caching, async |
| `maintainability` | Clean code, testability |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💎 Double Diamond Methodology</strong></summary>

### Phase 1: PROBE (Discover)
Parallel research from 4 perspectives - problem space, existing solutions, edge cases, technical feasibility.

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh probe "What are the best approaches for real-time notifications?"
```

### Phase 2: GRASP (Define)
Multi-tentacled consensus on problem definition, success criteria, and constraints.

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh grasp "Define requirements for notification system"
```

### Phase 3: TANGLE (Develop)
Enhanced map-reduce with 75% quality gate threshold.

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh tangle "Implement notification service"
```

### Phase 4: INK (Deliver)
Validation and final deliverable generation.

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh ink "Deliver notification system"
```

### Full Workflow

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh embrace "Create a complete user dashboard feature"
```

### Quality Gates

| Score | Status | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| >= 90% | PASSED | Proceed to ink |
| 75-89% | WARNING | Proceed with caution |
| < 75% | FAILED | Flags for review |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚡ Smart Auto-Routing</strong></summary>

The `auto` command extends the right tentacle for the job:

| Tentacle | Keywords | Routes To |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 🔍 Probe | research, explore, investigate | `probe` |
| 🤝 Grasp | define, clarify, scope | `grasp` |
| 🦑 Tangle | develop, build, implement | `tangle` → `ink` |
| 🖤 Ink | qa, test, validate | `ink` |
| 🤼 Grapple | adversarial, debate | `grapple` |
| 🦑 Squeeze | security audit, red team | `squeeze` |
| 🎨 Camouflage | design, UI, UX | `gemini` |
| ⚡ Jet | fix, debug, refactor | `codex` |
| 🖼️ Squirt | generate image, icon | `gemini-image` |

**Examples:**
```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "research caching best practices"    # -> probe
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "build the caching layer"            # -> tangle + ink
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "security audit the auth module"     # -> squeeze
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "fix the cache bug"                  # -> codex
```

### Commands not showing after install

If `/claude-octopus:setup` doesn't work after installation:

1. **Verify the plugin is installed:**

   In Claude Code chat:
   ```
   /plugin list
   ```
   Look for `claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins` in the installed plugins list.

2. **Restart Claude Code completely:**
   - Exit fully (Ctrl-C twice or Cmd+Q)
   - Restart: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`

3. **Reinstall if needed:**

   In Claude Code chat:
   ```
   /plugin uninstall claude-octopus
   /plugin marketplace update nyldn-plugins
   /plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
   ```

4. **Check debug logs for errors (from terminal):**
   ```bash
   tail -100 ~/.claude/debug/*.txt | grep -i "claude-octopus\|error"
   ```

5. **Check Claude Code version (from terminal):**
   ```bash
   claude --version  # Need 2.1.9+
   ```

### Pre-flight fails

```bash
./scripts/orchestrate.sh preflight
# Check: codex CLI, gemini CLI, API keys
```

### Quality gate failures

- Break into smaller subtasks
