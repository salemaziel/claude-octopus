# Claude Octopus

**Multi-AI orchestrator for Claude Code** - coordinates Codex, Gemini, and Claude CLIs using Double Diamond methodology.

> *Why have one AI do the work when you can have eight squabble about it productively?* 🐙

## TL;DR

| What It Does | How |
|--------------|-----|
| **Parallel AI execution** | Run multiple AI models simultaneously |
| **Structured workflows** | Double Diamond: Research → Define → Develop → Deliver |
| **Quality gates** | 75% consensus threshold before delivery |
| **Smart routing** | Auto-detects intent and picks the right AI model |
| **AI Debate Hub** | Structured 3-way debates (Claude + Gemini + Codex) |
| **Adversarial review** | AI vs AI debate catches more bugs |
| **Context-aware** | Auto-detects Dev vs Knowledge context for smarter workflows 🆕 |

**How to use it:**

Use the **"octo" prefix** for reliable multi-AI workflows, or slash commands:

- 💬 `octo research OAuth authentication patterns` - Multi-AI research
- 💬 `octo build a user authentication system` - Multi-AI implementation
- 💬 `octo review this code for security` - Multi-AI validation
- 💬 `octo debate Redis vs Memcached` - Three-way AI debate

---

## Quick Start

Get started with Claude Octopus in 2 simple steps:

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

Open Claude Code and run these two commands in the chat:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nyldn/claude-octopus
/plugin install octo@nyldn-plugins
```

The plugin is now installed and automatically enabled.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting Installation</summary>

**If you get "SSH authentication failed":**

Use the HTTPS URL format (already shown above). The shorthand `nyldn/claude-octopus` requires SSH keys configured with GitHub.

**If `/octo:setup` shows "Unknown skill" in Step 2:**

1. Verify the plugin is installed:
   ```
   /plugin list
   ```
   Look for `octo@nyldn-plugins` in the installed plugins list.

2. Try reinstalling:
   ```
   /plugin uninstall octo
   /plugin install octo@nyldn-plugins
   ```

3. Check for errors in debug logs (from terminal):
   ```bash
   tail -100 ~/.claude/debug/*.txt | grep -i "octo\|error"
   ```

4. Make sure you're on Claude Code v2.1.10 or later (from terminal):
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```

</details>

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Providers

Run the setup command in Claude Code:
```
/octo:setup
```

This will:
- Auto-detect what's already installed
- Show you exactly what you need (you only need ONE provider!)
- Give you shell-specific instructions
- Verify your setup when done

**No terminal context switching needed** - Claude guides you through everything!

### Step 3: Start Using It

Use the **"octo" prefix** for reliable workflow activation:

**For research:**
> `octo research microservices patterns and compare their trade-offs`

**For development:**
> `octo build a REST API for user management with authentication`

**For code review:**
> `octo review my authentication code for security issues`

**For debates:**
> `octo debate whether we should use GraphQL or REST for our API`

**Alternative: Slash commands** (always work reliably):
```
/octo:research microservices patterns
/octo:develop REST API for user management
/octo:review authentication code
/octo:debate GraphQL vs REST
```

Claude Octopus automatically detects which providers you have and uses them intelligently.

## Updating the Plugin

To get the latest version of Claude Octopus:

### Option A: Via Plugin UI
1. `/plugin` to open plugin screen
2. Navigate to "Installed" tab
3. Find `octo@nyldn-plugins`
4. Click update button if available

### Option B: Reinstall Manually
```

## Understanding Costs

**External CLIs use your API quotas:**
- 🔴 Codex CLI: OpenAI API costs (GPT-5.x based)
- 🟡 Gemini CLI: Google AI costs (Gemini 3.0)
- Typical costs: $0.01-0.10 per query

**Claude subagents are included:**
- 🔵 Claude Code Task tool: No additional cost
- Included with your Claude Code subscription

**When to use external CLIs (🐙):**
- Need multiple perspectives on a problem
- Research requires broad coverage
- Complex implementation needs different approaches
- Security review benefits from adversarial analysis
- High-stakes decisions

**When to use Claude only (no indicator):**
- Simple file operations
- Single perspective adequate
- Quick edits or fixes
- Cost efficiency important
- Straightforward tasks

### AI Debate Hub Integration

> **Built on the shoulders of giants** 🤝

Claude-octopus integrates **[AI Debate Hub](https://github.com/wolverin0/claude-skills)** by **[wolverin0](https://github.com/wolverin0)** with deep gratitude and proper attribution:

- **Original Repository**: https://github.com/wolverin0/claude-skills
- **Author**: wolverin0
- **License**: MIT
- **Integration Type**: Git submodule (read-only reference)
- **Version**: v4.7

**What it does**: Enables structured three-way debates where Claude, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI analyze problems from multiple perspectives. Claude actively participates as both a debater and moderator.

**Claude-octopus enhancements**:
- ✅ Session-aware storage (integrates with Claude Code sessions)
- ✅ Quality gates for debate responses (75% threshold)
- ✅ Cost tracking and analytics
- ✅ Document export to PPTX/DOCX/PDF (via document-delivery skill)
- ✅ Knowledge mode deliberation workflow

**Usage**:

Just use natural language to trigger debates:

```bash
# Basic debate
"Run a debate about whether we should use Redis or in-memory cache"

# Thorough analysis
"I want Gemini and Codex to review our API architecture with thorough analysis"

# Adversarial security review
"Run a debate about security vulnerabilities in auth.ts with adversarial analysis"

# Knowledge mode deliberation
/octo:km on
"Debate whether we should enter the European market"
```

**Initialize submodule** (if not auto-initialized):
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Update to latest** from wolverin0:
```bash
git submodule update --remote .dependencies/claude-skills

## Acknowledgments

Claude Octopus stands on the shoulders of giants:

- **[wolverin0/claude-skills](https://github.com/wolverin0/claude-skills)** by **wolverin0** - AI Debate Hub enables structured three-way debates between Claude, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI. Integrated as a git submodule with claude-octopus enhancements (quality gates, cost tracking, document export). wolverin0's innovative "Claude as participant" design pattern is brilliant—Claude doesn't just orchestrate, it actively debates. This integration demonstrates proper open-source collaboration: clear attribution, hybrid approach (original + enhancement layer), and a path to contribute improvements back upstream. MIT License.

- **[obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** by **Jesse Vincent** - Several discipline skills (TDD, systematic debugging, verification, planning, branch finishing) were inspired by the excellent patterns in this Claude Code skills library. The "Iron Law" enforcement approach and anti-rationalization techniques are particularly valuable. MIT License.

- **Double Diamond** methodology by the [UK Design Council](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/) - The Discover/Define/Develop/Deliver workflow structure (with playful aliases probe/grasp/tangle/ink) provides a proven framework for divergent and convergent thinking in design and development.
