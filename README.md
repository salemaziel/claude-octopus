# Claude Octopus

A Claude Code plugin that turns one model into three. Orchestrates Codex, Gemini, and Claude with distinct roles, adversarial review, and consensus gates — so no single model's blind spots slip through.

🐙 **Three brains, one workflow.** Other multi-AI tools run providers in parallel and hand you three answers. Octopus assigns each model a distinct role — Codex for implementation depth, Gemini for ecosystem breadth, Claude for synthesis — then enforces a 75% consensus gate before anything ships. Disagreements get caught, not ignored.

⚡ **Spec in, software out.** Dark Factory mode takes a spec and autonomously runs the full pipeline — research, define, develop, deliver — with holdout testing and satisfaction scoring. You review the output, not every step.

🔄 **Methodology, not just machinery.** Built on the Double Diamond framework, every task moves through four structured phases: discover, define, develop, deliver. Quality gates between phases mean sloppy work can't advance. Other orchestrators give you infrastructure to build workflows on — Octopus gives you the workflows.

🐙 **32 specialized personas, 38 commands, 50 skills.** Not generic agents. A security-auditor that thinks in OWASP. A backend-architect that designs APIs. A ui-ux-designer grounded in BM25 design intelligence. Personas activate automatically based on what you ask — say "audit my API" and the right expert shows up. Don't know the command name? Just say what you need — the smart router figures it out.

🐙 **Works with just Claude. Scales to three.** Zero external providers needed to start. You get every persona, every workflow, every skill on day one. Add Codex or Gemini and multi-AI orchestration lights up — parallel research, adversarial debate, cross-model review.

💰 **Subscription Advantage.** Codex and Gemini authenticate via OAuth, so if you already subscribe to ChatGPT or Google AI you pay nothing extra — no API keys required.

## Quickstart

**Install from Claude Code:**

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nyldn/claude-octopus.git
/plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins
```

**Or from your terminal:**

```bash
claude -p "/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nyldn/claude-octopus.git"
claude -p "/plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins"
```

**Factory AI (Droid):**

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/nyldn/claude-octopus
droid plugin install claude-octopus@claude-octopus
```

> See [docs/FACTORY-AI.md](docs/FACTORY-AI.md) for full Factory AI setup instructions.

Then run setup:

```
/octo:setup
```

Setup detects installed providers, shows what's missing, and walks you through configuration. You need **zero** external providers to start — Claude is built in. Add Codex or Gemini for multi-AI features.

## Top 8 Tentacles

🐙 Eight commands — one per arm. *A real octopus has eight arms, each with its own neurons that can act independently.* These eight tentacles work the same way: each orchestrates up to three AI providers, applies quality gates, and produces a deliverable.

```bash
/octo:embrace build stripe integration     # Full lifecycle: research → define → develop → deliver
/octo:factory "build a CLI that converts CSV to JSON"  # Autonomous pipeline — spec in, software out
/octo:debate monorepo vs microservices     # Structured three-way AI debate with consensus
/octo:research htmx vs react in 2026       # Multi-source synthesis from three AI providers
/octo:design mobile checkout redesign       # UI/UX design with BM25 style intelligence
/octo:tdd create user auth                 # Red-green-refactor with test discipline
/octo:security                              # OWASP vulnerability scan + remediation
/octo:prd mobile checkout redesign          # AI-optimized PRD with 100-point scoring
```

Plus 30 more: review, debug, extract, deck, docs, schedule, parallel, sentinel, brainstorm, claw, doctor, and [the full set](docs/COMMAND-REFERENCE.md).

Don't remember the command name? Just describe what you need:

```
/octo research microservices patterns    -> routes to discover phase
/octo build user authentication          -> routes to develop phase
/octo compare Redis vs DynamoDB          -> routes to debate
```

The smart router parses your intent and selects the right workflow.

## Which Tentacle?

Not sure which command to use? Pick by goal:

| I want to... | Use |
|--------------|-----|
| Research a topic thoroughly | `/octo:research` or `/octo:discover` |
| Debate two approaches | `/octo:debate` |
| Build a feature end-to-end | `/octo:embrace` |
| Design a UI or style system | `/octo:design` |
| Review existing code | `/octo:review` |
| Write tests first, then code | `/octo:tdd` |
| Scan for vulnerabilities | `/octo:security` |
| Write a product spec | `/octo:prd` |
| Go from spec to shipping code | `/octo:factory` |
| Debug a tricky issue | `/octo:debug` |
| Just run something quick | `/octo:quick` |

Or skip the table — type `/octo <what you want>` and the smart router picks for you. 🔍

## How It Works

### Three Providers, One Workflow

Claude Octopus coordinates Codex (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Claude (Anthropic) across every workflow. Each provider has a distinct role:

| Provider | Role |
|----------|------|
| Codex | Implementation depth — code patterns, technical analysis, architecture |
| Gemini | Ecosystem breadth — alternatives, security review, research synthesis |
| Claude | Orchestration — quality gates, consensus building, final synthesis |

Providers run in parallel for research, sequentially for problem scoping, and adversarially for review. A 75% consensus quality gate prevents questionable work from shipping.

### Double Diamond Phases

Four structured phases adapted from the UK Design Council's methodology:

| Phase | Command | What happens |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Discover | `/octo:discover` | Multi-AI research and broad exploration |
| Define | `/octo:define` | Requirements clarification with consensus |
| Develop | `/octo:develop` | Implementation with quality gates |
| Deliver | `/octo:deliver` | Adversarial review and go/no-go scoring |

Run phases individually or all four with `/octo:embrace`. Configure autonomy: supervised (approve each phase), semi-autonomous (intervene on failures), or autonomous (run all four).

### 32 Personas

Specialized agents that activate automatically based on your request. When you say "audit my API for vulnerabilities," security-auditor activates. When you say "design a dashboard," ui-ux-designer takes over.

Categories: Software Engineering (11), Specialized Development (6), Documentation & Communication (5), Research & Strategy (3), Business & Compliance (3), Creative & Design (4).

## Providers and Cost

### Authentication

| Method | Codex | Gemini | Claude |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| OAuth (recommended) | `codex login` — included in ChatGPT subscription | Google account — included in AI subscription | Built into Claude Code |
| API key | `OPENAI_API_KEY` — per-token billing | `GEMINI_API_KEY` — per-token billing | Built into Claude Code |

OAuth users pay nothing beyond their existing subscriptions.

### What Works Without External Providers

Everything except multi-AI features. You get all 32 personas, structured workflows, smart routing, context detection, and every skill. Multi-AI orchestration (parallel analysis, debate, consensus) activates when external providers are configured.

---

## Trust and Safety

**Namespace isolation** — Only `/octo:*` commands and `octo` natural language prefix activate the plugin. Your existing Claude Code setup is untouched.

**Data locations** — Results in `~/.claude-octopus/results/`, logs in `~/.claude-octopus/logs/`, project state in `.octo/`. Nothing hidden.

**No telemetry** — No usage data collected. No phone-home. Fully open source.

**Provider transparency** — Visual indicators (colored dots) show exactly which providers are running and when external APIs are called. You always know what's happening.

**Clean uninstall** — `/plugin uninstall claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins` removes everything. If you see a scope error, add `--scope project`. No residual config changes.

## OpenClaw Compatibility

Claude Octopus ships with a compatibility layer for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), the open-source AI assistant framework. This lets you expose Octopus workflows to messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, Signal, WhatsApp) without modifying the Claude Code plugin.

### Architecture

```
Claude Code Plugin (unchanged)
  └── .mcp.json ─── MCP Server ─── orchestrate.sh
                                        ↑
OpenClaw Extension ─────────────────────┘
```

Three components, zero changes to the core plugin:

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| MCP Server | `mcp-server/` | Exposes 10 Octopus tools via Model Context Protocol |
| OpenClaw Extension | `openclaw/` | Wraps workflows for OpenClaw's extension API |
| Skill Schema | `mcp-server/src/schema/skill-schema.json` | Universal skill metadata format |

### MCP Server

The MCP server auto-starts when the plugin is enabled (via `.mcp.json`). It exposes:

- `octopus_discover`, `octopus_define`, `octopus_develop`, `octopus_deliver` — Individual phases
- `octopus_embrace` — Full Double Diamond workflow
- `octopus_debate`, `octopus_review`, `octopus_security` — Specialized workflows
- `octopus_list_skills`, `octopus_status` — Introspection

Any MCP-compatible client can connect to the server.

### OpenClaw Extension

Install in an OpenClaw instance from git:

```bash
npm install github:nyldn/claude-octopus#main --prefix openclaw
```

Or clone and link locally:

```bash
cd openclaw && npm install && npm run build
```

The extension registers as an OpenClaw plugin with configurable workflows, autonomy modes, and Claude Code path resolution.

### Build & Validate

```bash
./scripts/build-openclaw.sh          # Regenerate skill registry from frontmatter
./scripts/build-openclaw.sh --check  # CI mode — exits non-zero if out of sync
./tests/validate-openclaw.sh         # 13-check validation suite
```

## FAQ

**Do I need all three AI providers?**
No. One external provider plus Claude gives you multi-AI features. No external providers still gives you personas, workflows, and skills.

**Will this break my existing Claude Code setup?**
No. Activates only with the `octo` prefix. Results stored separately. Uninstalls cleanly.

**What happens if a provider times out?**
The workflow continues with available providers. You'll see the status in the visual indicators.

**Why "octopus"?**
🐙 *Fun fact: a real octopus has three hearts, blue blood, and 500 million neurons — two-thirds of which live in its eight arms.* Each arm can taste, touch, and act independently. Claude Octopus works the same way: each tentacle (command) operates autonomously with its own squeeze of logic, then ink flows back as the final deliverable. The crossfire review? That's the squeeze — adversarial pressure that untangles everything before it ships.
