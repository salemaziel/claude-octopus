# /octo:octo → /octo:auto (Legacy Redirect)

This command has been renamed to `/octo:auto`. Invoking `/octo:octo` still works for backward compatibility.

## EXECUTION CONTRACT (Mandatory)

When the user invokes `/octo:octo <query>`, you MUST:

1. Inform the user: "Note: `/octo:octo` has been renamed to `/octo:auto`. Routing your request now."
2. Immediately invoke: `Skill(skill: "octo:auto", args: "<full user query>")`
3. If the routed workflow dispatches multiple providers, surface `${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/orchestrate.sh agent-summary` before final synthesis when available.

Do NOT duplicate the routing logic here — delegate entirely to `/octo:auto`.
