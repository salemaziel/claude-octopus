# Sentinel (/octo:sentinel)

**Your first output line MUST be:** `🐙 Octopus Sentinel`

GitHub-aware work monitor that triages issues, PRs, and CI failures. Sentinel observes and recommends workflows but never auto-executes them.

## MANDATORY COMPLIANCE — DO NOT SKIP

**When the user explicitly invokes `/octo:sentinel`, you MUST run the Sentinel orchestrator path below.** You are PROHIBITED from manually guessing repository status, skipping GitHub checks, or starting remediation without explicit user approval.

## Usage

```bash
/octo:sentinel              # One-time triage scan
/octo:sentinel --watch       # Continuous monitoring
/octo:sentinel --canary      # Post-deploy canary monitoring
```

## Scheduled Claude Code Web Usage

For recurring triage, schedule Sentinel as a read-only Claude Code web or hosted task. Use `/octo:sentinel` for the normal scan and `/octo:sentinel --canary https://example.com` for post-deploy monitoring.

Scheduled Sentinel should stay triage-only. It may recommend `/octo:debug`,
`/octo:review`, or `/octo:embrace`, but it must not start remediation unless
the user explicitly asks for it.

## What Sentinel Monitors

| Source | Filter | Recommended Action |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Issues | `octopus` label | Classified via task type → workflow recommendation |
| PRs | Review requested | `/octo:ink` for code review |
| CI Runs | Failed status | `/octo:debug` for investigation |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OCTOPUS_SENTINEL_ENABLED` | `false` | Must be `true` to activate |
| `OCTOPUS_SENTINEL_INTERVAL` | `600` | Poll interval for --watch mode (seconds) |

## Safety

Sentinel is **triage-only**. It:
- Reads GitHub state (issues, PRs, CI runs)
- Classifies and recommends workflows
- Writes findings to `.octo/sentinel/triage-log.md`
- **Never** auto-executes any workflow

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a GitHub repository

## EXECUTION CONTRACT (Mandatory)

When the user invokes `/octo:sentinel`, you MUST:

### 1. Check Prerequisites
- Verify `OCTOPUS_SENTINEL_ENABLED=true` is set
- Verify `gh` CLI is available

### 2. Execute Sentinel
```bash
OCTOPUS_SENTINEL_ENABLED=true bash scripts/orchestrate.sh sentinel $ARGUMENTS
```

### 3. Fire Reaction Engine (v8.45.0)
After triage, run the reaction engine to auto-respond to detected events:
```bash
# Check all active agents and fire reactions
REACTIONS="${HOME}/.claude-octopus/plugin/scripts/reactions.sh"
if [[ -x "$REACTIONS" ]]; then
  "$REACTIONS" check-all
fi
```

This automatically forwards CI failure logs to agents, forwards review comments, and escalates stuck agents — without requiring any new user commands.

### 4. Present Results
- Show triaged items with recommended workflows
- Show any reactions that fired (CI log forwarding, escalations)
- Display path to triage log
- If --watch mode, explain how to stop (Ctrl+C)
