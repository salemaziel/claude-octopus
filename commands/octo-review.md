# /octo:review

## MANDATORY COMPLIANCE — DO NOT SKIP

**When the user invokes `/octo:review`, you MUST execute the multi-LLM review workflow below. You are PROHIBITED from:**
- Doing a direct code review without running the structured workflow
- Deciding the scope is "too broad" and narrowing it yourself — the user chose the scope
- Skipping the provider check or AskUserQuestion steps
- Substituting a simpler review approach because it seems "more effective"
- Running two background Sonnet agents instead of the full multi-provider pipeline

**The user chose `/octo:review` over a regular code review deliberately.** They want multi-provider perspectives (Codex + Gemini + Claude), not a single-model review. If you catch yourself thinking "a focused audit would be more effective" — STOP. That is the exact rationalization this instruction prohibits.

### EXECUTION MECHANISM — NON-NEGOTIABLE

**You MUST execute this command by calling `orchestrate.sh` as documented below. You are PROHIBITED from:**
- ❌ Doing the work yourself using only Claude-native tools (Agent, Read, Grep, Write)
- ❌ Using a single Claude subagent instead of multi-provider dispatch via orchestrate.sh
- ❌ Skipping orchestrate.sh because "I can do this faster directly"

**Multi-LLM orchestration is the purpose of this command.** If you execute using only Claude, you've violated the command's contract.

🐙 **CLAUDE OCTOPUS ACTIVATED** — Multi-LLM Code Review

Providers:
🔴 Codex CLI — logic and correctness
🟡 Gemini CLI — security and edge cases
🔵 Claude — architecture and synthesis
🟣 Perplexity — CVE lookup (if available)

When the user invokes this command (e.g., `/octo:review <arguments>`):

## Step 1: Ask Clarifying Questions / Context Acquisition

**Determine mode based on session autonomy:**

If `AUTONOMY_MODE` env var is `autonomous`, or session is running headlessly, or `OCTOPUS_WORKFLOW_PHASE` is set (indicating a pipeline context like `/octo:develop` or `/octo:embrace`), skip Q&A and auto-infer with ALL focus areas:
1. Run `git diff --cached` — if non-empty, `target=staged`
2. Run `gh pr view --json number` — if open PR exists, set `target=<pr_number>`
3. Otherwise `target=working-tree`
4. Set `provenance=unknown`, `autonomy=autonomous`, `publish=ask`, `debate=auto`, `focus=["correctness","security","architecture","tdd"]`

**Otherwise (supervised mode), you MUST use AskUserQuestion to ask these questions:**

```javascript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What should be reviewed?",
      header: "Target",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Staged changes", description: "git diff --cached — what you're about to commit"},
        {label: "Open PR", description: "Review the current branch's open pull request"},
        {label: "Working tree", description: "All uncommitted changes"},
        {label: "Specific path", description: "A file or directory"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What should the fleet focus on?",
      header: "Focus",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {label: "Correctness", description: "Logic bugs, edge cases, regressions"},
        {label: "Security & Edge Cases", description: "OWASP, race conditions, partial failures"},
        {label: "Architecture", description: "API contracts, integration, breaking changes"},
        {label: "TDD discipline", description: "Verify failing-test-first evidence and minimal implementation"},
        {label: "All areas (Recommended)", description: "Correctness + Security + Architecture + TDD"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "How was this code produced?",
      header: "Provenance",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Human-authored", description: "Standard review"},
        {label: "AI-assisted", description: "Review for over-abstraction and weak tests"},
        {label: "Autonomous / Dark Factory", description: "Elevated rigor: verify tests, wiring, operational safety"},
        {label: "Unknown", description: "Assume less context, verify from code and tests"}
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Should findings be posted to the open PR?",
      header: "Publish",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {label: "Ask me after review", description: "Show findings first, then decide"},
        {label: "Auto-post if confident", description: "Post inline comments when confidence ≥ 85%"},
        {label: "Never — terminal only", description: "Always show in terminal, never post to PR"}
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**WAIT for the user's answers before proceeding.**

## Step 1b: Scope Drift Check (informational)

Before building the review profile, run scope drift detection to compare the diff against stated intent. This gives reviewers early awareness of scope creep or missing requirements.

Load `skills/skill-scope-drift/SKILL.md` and execute the drift analysis. Display the structured report (CLEAN / DRIFT DETECTED / REQUIREMENTS MISSING). **This never blocks the review** — proceed to Step 2 regardless.

If no intent sources are found (no TODOS.md, no PR body, no commit messages), skip silently.

---

## Step 2: Build Review Profile

After receiving answers, map them to a JSON profile:

```javascript
const profile = {
  target: <from answer or inference>,  // "staged" | "working-tree" | PR# | path
  focus: <multi-select answers as array>,
  provenance: <answer>,                // "human" | "ai-assisted" | "autonomous" | "unknown"
  autonomy: <detected mode>,           // "supervised" | "autonomous"
  publish: <answer>,                   // "ask" | "auto" | "never"
  debate: "auto"                       // always default to auto debate
}
```

## Step 3: Execute Review Pipeline

Run via Bash tool:

```bash
/path/to/orchestrate.sh code-review '<profile-json>'
```

Where `<profile-json>` is the JSON profile built in Step 2.

The pipeline runs 3 rounds (parallel fleet → verification → synthesis) and outputs findings. If a PR is open and publish is not "never", it offers to post inline comments.

## What `/octo:review` checks

- Correctness: logic bugs, edge cases, regressions, unreachable code
- Security: OWASP Top 10, injection, auth flaws, data exposure (Gemini specialist)
- Architecture: API contracts, integration issues, breaking changes (Claude specialist)
- CVE lookup: known vulnerabilities in dependencies (Perplexity → Gemini → Claude WebSearch)
- TDD compliance and test-first evidence (when provenance is AI-assisted/autonomous)
- Autonomous codegen risk: placeholder logic, unwired code, speculative abstractions

## REVIEW.md support

Add a `REVIEW.md` file to your repository root to guide what `/octo:review` flags.
Drop-in compatible with Claude Code's managed Code Review service.

```markdown
# Code Review Guidelines

## Always check
- New API endpoints have corresponding integration tests

## Style
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals

## Skip
- Generated files under src/gen/
```
