# Ink - Delivery Phase (Double Diamond)

## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

When the user invokes this command (e.g., `/octo:ink <arguments>`):

**✓ CORRECT - Use the Skill tool:**
```
Skill(skill: "octo:ink", args: "<user's arguments>")
```

**✗ INCORRECT - Do NOT use Task tool:**
```
Task(subagent_type: "octo:ink", ...)  ❌ Wrong! This is a skill, not an agent type
```

**Why:** This command loads the `flow-deliver` skill (alias: `ink`). Skills use the `Skill` tool, not `Task`.

---

**Auto-loads the `flow-deliver` skill for the validation/delivery phase.**

## Quick Usage

Just use natural language:
```
"Review the authentication code"
"Ink validation for the payment integration"
"Quality check the API implementation"
```

## What Is Ink?

The **Deliver** phase of the Double Diamond methodology:
- Convergent validation
- Quality assurance
- Security review
- Production readiness

## What You Get

- Comprehensive code review
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance analysis
- Test coverage validation
- Production readiness checklist

## Validation Checks

- Code quality (style, patterns, maintainability)
- Security (OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities)
- Performance (bottlenecks, optimizations)
- Tests (coverage, quality, edge cases)
- Documentation (completeness, clarity)

## When To Use

- Before merging code
- Pre-production deployment
- Feature completion
- Quality gates
- Security audits

## Natural Language Examples

```
"Review the authentication module for production"
"Ink validation of the payment processing code"
"Quality assurance check for the new API"
```
