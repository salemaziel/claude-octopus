## [4.9.5] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

#### Setup Command Path Resolution (Critical)
- **Fixed `/claude-octopus:setup` command failing with "no such file or directory" error**
- Updated `.claude/commands/setup.md` to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.sh` instead of relative paths
- Works correctly when plugin installed via marketplace (versioned cache directory)
- Applied fix to all 3 script invocations in setup command (detect-providers, verify, help)

#### Plugin Installation Simplified
- **Reduced installation from 4-5 terminal commands to just 2 slash commands**
- New Quick Start: `/plugin marketplace add` and `/plugin install` (inside Claude Code chat)
- Matches installation pattern of official plugins (Vercel, Figma, Superpowers, Medusa)
- Users stay in Claude Code chat instead of switching to terminal
- README.md Quick Start section completely rewritten for clarity

#### Skill Activation
- **Removed permission prompt when activating plugin**
- Plugin now activates automatically when needed
- Improved user experience for first-time setup

### Added

#### Recommended Companion Skills Documentation
- **New "Recommended Companion Skills" section in README.md**
- Organized by category: Testing & Validation, Customization & Extension, Integration, Design & Frontend
- Recommended skills: webapp-testing, skill-creator, mcp-builder, frontend-design, artifacts-builder
- Added "How Skills Work with Claude Octopus" explanation
- Clarifies that skills are available to Claude (orchestrator), not spawned agents

#### Test Infrastructure Validation
- **New integration test: `test-plugin-lifecycle.sh`** (11/11 assertions passing)
- Validates full plugin install/uninstall/update workflow
- Tests marketplace addition, plugin installation, file verification, and cleanup
- Comprehensive test suite results: 6/7 test suites passing
- Smoke tests: 4/4 PASSED ✅
- Unit tests: 3/4 PASSED (1 known issue for internal commands)
- Integration tests: 2/2 PASSED ✅

### Changed

- README.md installation instructions simplified throughout
- Troubleshooting sections updated to use slash commands
- TEST-STATUS.md updated with latest test run results (2026-01-17 03:57)

### Notes

This release focuses on removing installation friction and fixing the critical setup command issue. The 2-command installation process (`/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install`) makes Claude Octopus as easy to install as official plugins. The `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` fix ensures the setup command works correctly regardless of installation method.

**Migration from v4.9.4:**
- Existing users: Update plugin with `/plugin update claude-octopus`
- Restart Claude Code after updating
- Setup command will now work correctly

---

## [4.9.4] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed

#### Installer Marketplace Configuration
- **Fixed critical bug** preventing Claude Code startup after installation
- Removed creation of "local" marketplace entry that caused "Marketplace configuration file is corrupted" error
- Changed to use `claude-octopus-marketplace` as marketplace identifier (doesn't require marketplace to exist)
- Added cleanup of broken "local" marketplace entries from previous installation attempts
- Plugin now registers as `claude-octopus@claude-octopus-marketplace`

### Known Issues

The curl-based installer in v4.9.3 and v4.9.4 still does not work reliably due to Claude Code's marketplace architecture requirements. Users should install using the official plugin manager:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add nyldn/claude-octopus
claude plugin install claude-octopus@nyldn-plugins --scope user
claude plugin enable claude-octopus --scope user
claude plugin update claude-octopus --scope user
```

See README.md for updated installation instructions. The install.sh script will be updated in a future release to use these commands.

#### Conversational Documentation
- **Replaced CLI commands** with natural language examples in all user-facing docs
- Commands/setup.md: Rich conversational examples organized by category (Research, Implementation, Code Review, Adversarial Testing, Full Workflows)
- README.md: Simplified Quick Start emphasizing natural conversation over CLI
- skill.md: Added callout that Claude Code users don't need to run commands

#### Claude Code Version Check
- **Automatic version detection** - Checks Claude Code version during setup
- **Minimum version requirement** - Requires Claude Code 2.1.9 or higher
- **Multiple detection methods** - Tries `claude --version`, `claude version`, and package.json locations
- **Semantic version comparison** - Properly compares version numbers (e.g., 2.1.9 vs 2.1.8)
- **Prominent upgrade warnings** - Shows clear update instructions if outdated
- **Installation-specific guidance** - Provides commands for npm, Homebrew, and direct download
- **Parseable output** - Returns `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`, `CLAUDE_CODE_STATUS` (ok/outdated/unknown), `CLAUDE_CODE_MINIMUM`
- **Integrated into setup flow** - Runs automatically in `/claude-octopus:setup` and `detect-providers`
- **Skill routing** - skill.md documents Scenario 0 for outdated version handling (stops execution until updated)
- **Restart reminder** - Explicitly tells users to restart Claude Code after updating

### Changed - Simplified Setup Requirements

#### One Provider Required (Not Both)
- **Breaking change**: Users only need ONE provider (Codex OR Gemini) to get started
- Previous: Both Codex AND Gemini required
- New: Choose either based on preference (Codex for code gen, Gemini for analysis)
- Graceful degradation: Multi-provider tasks adapt to single provider
- Clear messaging: "You only need ONE provider to use Claude Octopus"

#### Updated Prerequisites Check (skill.md)
- **Automatic fast detection** - Non-blocking provider check replaces manual status command
- **Three scenarios** with clear routing logic:
  - Both missing: Show setup instructions, STOP
  - One working: Proceed with available provider
  - Both working: Use both for comprehensive analysis
- Emphasizes: "One is sufficient for most tasks"
- Cache optimization: Skip re-detection if cache valid (<1 hour)

#### Setup Command Redesign (commands/setup.md)
- Complete rewrite focusing on conversational usage
- Removed references to interactive terminal wizard
- Added shell-specific instructions (zsh vs bash)
- Expanded troubleshooting section
- Clear section: "Do I Need Both Providers?" (Answer: No!)

- Removed "Configure Claude Octopus" step (no longer needed)
- Optional verification step moved to end

### Deprecated

#### Interactive Setup Wizard
- **init_interactive()** function deprecated (will be removed in v5.0)
- Shows deprecation warning with migration path
- Explains benefits of new approach:
  - Faster onboarding (one provider vs two)
  - Clearer instructions (no confusing interactive prompts)
  - Works in Claude Code (no terminal switching)
  - Environment variables for API keys (more secure)
- Users redirected to `detect-providers` command

### Fixed

#### Provider Detection Output
- Fixed auth detection showing duplicate values (e.g., "oauth\napi-key")
- Now correctly shows single auth method per provider

### Notes

This is a major UX release that redesigns the entire setup experience to align with official Claude Code plugin patterns (Vercel, GitHub, Figma). The goal is to keep users in Claude Code without terminal context switching, while making setup faster and clearer. The interactive wizard is deprecated in favor of fast auto-detection + environment variables.

**Breaking Changes:**
- Old `init_interactive` wizard shows deprecation warning
- Documentation now emphasizes conversational usage over CLI commands

**Migration Path:**
- Existing users: Continue using current setup, or migrate to environment variables
- New users: Install one CLI, set API key, done

### Added
- **Cost-Aware Auto-Routing** - Intelligent model tier selection based on task complexity
  - Analyzes prompts to estimate complexity (trivial, standard, complex)
  - Routes trivial tasks to cheaper models (`codex-mini`, `gemini-fast`)
  - Routes complex tasks to premium models (`codex`, `gemini-pro`)
  - Prevents expensive models from being wasted on simple tasks
- **Cost Control CLI Flags**
  - `-Q, --quick` - Force cheapest model tier
  - `-P, --premium` - Force premium model tier
  - `--tier LEVEL` - Explicit tier: trivial|standard|premium
- Complexity displayed in task analysis output

### Changed
- `auto_route()` now uses `get_tiered_agent()` for cost-aware model selection
- Help text updated with Cost Control section

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Interactive Setup Wizard** (`./scripts/orchestrate.sh setup`)
  - Step-by-step guided configuration for first-time users
  - Auto-installs Codex CLI and Gemini CLI via npm
  - Opens API key pages in browser (OpenAI, Google AI Studio)
  - Prompts for API keys with validation
  - Optionally persists keys to shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
- **First-Run Detection** - Suggests setup wizard when dependencies are missing
- **`/octopus-setup` Command** - Claude Code integration for setup wizard
- Cross-platform browser opening (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Fixed
- **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Fixed environment variable mismatch (was checking GOOGLE_API_KEY)
- Added legacy GOOGLE_API_KEY fallback for backwards compatibility
- Interactive prompt for missing Gemini API key in preflight check

### Changed
- Updated Quick Start docs with setup wizard instructions
- Reorganized help output with "Getting Started" section
- Added test output directories to .gitignore

### Added

#### Double Diamond Methodology
Multi-tentacled orchestration workflow with octopus-themed commands:
- **probe** - Parallel research from 4 perspectives with AI synthesis (Discover phase)
- **grasp** - Multi-tentacled consensus building on problem definition (Define phase)
- **tangle** - Enhanced map-reduce with quality gates (Develop phase)
- **ink** - Validation and final deliverable generation (Deliver phase)
- **embrace** - Full 4-phase Double Diamond workflow
- **preflight** - Dependency validation before workflows

#### Intelligent Auto-Routing
Smart task classification routes to appropriate agents:
- **Image generation**: App icons, favicons, diagrams, social media banners, hero images
- **Code review**: Security audits, code analysis, PR reviews
- **Coding**: Implementation, debugging, refactoring
- **Design**: UI/UX analysis, accessibility, component design
- **Research**: Documentation, architecture analysis, best practices
- **Copywriting**: Marketing copy, content generation

#### Nano Banana Prompt Refinement
Intelligent prompt enhancement for image generation:
- Automatic detection of image type (app-icon, social-media, diagram, general)
- Type-specific prompt optimization for better visual results
- Integrated into auto-routing for seamless UX

#### Autonomy Modes
Configurable human oversight levels:
- **autonomous** - Full auto, proceed on failures
- **semi-autonomous** - Pause on quality gate failures (default)
- **supervised** - Human approval after each phase
- **loop-until-approved** - Retry failed tasks until quality gate passes

#### Session Recovery
Resume interrupted workflows:
- Automatic checkpoint after each phase completion
- Session state persisted to JSON
- Resume with `-R` flag from last successful phase

#### Specialized Agent Roles
Role-based agent selection for phases:
- **Architect** - System design and planning (Codex Max)
- **Researcher** - Deep investigation (Gemini Pro)
- **Reviewer** - Code review and validation (Codex Review)
- **Implementer** - Code generation (Codex Max)
- **Synthesizer** - Result aggregation (Gemini Flash)

#### Quality Gates
Configurable quality thresholds:
- Default 75% success threshold (configurable with `-q`)
- Quality gate status: PASSED (>=90%), WARNING (75-89%), FAILED (<75%)
- Loop-until-approved retry logic (up to 3 retries by default)

#### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Core execution patterns:
- **spawn** - Single agent execution
- **fan-out** - Same prompt to all agents
- **map-reduce** - Task decomposition and parallel execution
- **parallel** - JSON-defined task execution

#### Agent Fleet
Premium model defaults (Jan 2026):
- `codex` - GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (premium default)
- `codex-standard` - GPT-5.2-Codex
