## [8.42.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Mandatory compliance blocks** on all 8 workflow commands (embrace, discover, define,
  develop, deliver, plan, review, security) — Claude is now explicitly prohibited from
  skipping workflows it judges "too simple." Addresses user reports of `/octo:embrace`
  being bypassed for straightforward tasks.
- **Interactive next-steps** after every workflow completes — all phase commands and embrace
  now ask the user what to do next via `AskUserQuestion` instead of ending silently.
- **Anti-injection nonces** (`sanitize_external_content()` in orchestrate.sh) — wraps
  file-sourced content (memory files, provider history, earned skills) in random hex
  boundary tokens to prevent prompt injection from untrusted external content.
- **Session learnings layer** — `session-end.sh` now writes `octopus-learnings.md` to
  auto-memory with per-session meta-reflection (workflow, phase, agent calls, errors, debate).
- **Feature gap analysis** — `docs/FEATURE-GAP.md` living document tracks all 72 CC feature
  flags with Green/Yellow/Red adoption status and gap closure history.
- **Multi-LLM debate gates** in embrace, plan, review, security, and define commands —
  optional Claude + Codex + Gemini deliberation at workflow transition points.

### Fixed

- Reinstated `/octo:debate` and `/octo:research` commands wrongly removed in v8.41.0
  consolidation. These had unique standalone functionality (three-way AI debates and
  deep multi-AI research respectively).
- Removed "Don't use for" sections from phase commands that contradicted mandatory
  compliance blocks and encouraged Claude to skip workflows.
- Command count corrected: 36 → 38 (debate + research reinstated).

### Changed

- OpenClaw registry updated: 86 → 88 entries (debate + research commands).
- All debate-related options across commands now explicitly say "Multi-LLM" and name
  all three models (Claude + Codex + Gemini) so users understand what they're enabling.

## [8.41.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- 3 new hook events registered in hooks.json:
  - `PreCompact` — persists workflow state (phase, decisions, blockers) before context compaction
  - `SessionEnd` — finalizes metrics, persists preferences to auto-memory, cleans up session artifacts
  - `UserPromptSubmit` — classifies task intent via keyword matching for improved skill routing
- 10 native agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` mirroring top personas:
  - security-auditor, code-reviewer, backend-architect, tdd-orchestrator, debugger,
    performance-engineer, frontend-developer, docs-architect, cloud-architect, database-architect
- Persona-agent sync test ensuring every agent definition has a matching persona file
- Auto-memory integration: SessionEnd hook writes `octopus-preferences.md` to project memory
  with autonomy mode, provider config, and last update timestamp
- `enable-http-telemetry.sh` script for converting shell-based telemetry to native HTTP hooks (CC v2.1.63+)
- Mixed models integration: `_get_agent_model_raw()` now checks `CLAUDE_MODEL` env var (Priority 0.5)
  for Claude-side agents, respecting native CC model settings without duplicate config
- Spec mode plan view alignment: `flow-spec.md` Step 7.5 uses `EnterPlanMode` for NLSpec review
  when VSCode plan view is available (CC v2.1.70+), with graceful terminal fallback
- 89-test suite (`test-v8.41.0-feature-adoption.sh`) covering hooks, agents, sync, droids, telemetry, and auto-memory
- Factory droid generation in `build-factory-skills.sh` — generates `agents/droids/` from `.claude/agents/`
  so Factory AI discovers native droids alongside Claude Code agent definitions
- Native HTTP telemetry hook in hooks.json (`"type": "http"`) alongside shell fallback;
  shell hook skips when `SUPPORTS_HTTP_HOOKS=true` to avoid double telemetry
- SessionStart auto-memory restoration (`session-start-memory.sh`) — reads persisted preferences
  from `octopus-preferences.md` on session start and injects them into `session.json`

### Changed

- Command consolidation: 13 thin wrapper commands removed (49 → 36 commands)
  - 8 pure wrappers deleted: issues, ship, rollback, debate, resume, setup, validate, status
  - 5 flow aliases deleted: probe, grasp, tangle, ink, research
  - Matching skills now have `user-invocable: true` frontmatter for direct invocation
- Hook event count: 10 → 13 (PreCompact, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit)
- Total hook scripts: 25 → 29
- Task manager simplified: `create_embrace_tasks()` and `create_phase_task()` deprecated
  in favor of native TodoWrite for Claude-side task tracking
- Telemetry webhook updated: native HTTP hook entry in hooks.json with shell fallback;
  shell hook has `SUPPORTS_HTTP_HOOKS` guard to skip when HTTP hooks are active

---

## [8.40.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- 6 new Claude Code feature detection flags for v2.1.70-71:
  - `SUPPORTS_VSCODE_PLAN_VIEW` — VSCode full markdown plan view with comments (v2.1.70+)
  - `SUPPORTS_IMAGE_CACHE_COMPACTION` — compaction preserves images for prompt cache reuse (v2.1.70+)
  - `SUPPORTS_RENAME_WHILE_PROCESSING` — `/rename` works during processing (v2.1.70+)
  - `SUPPORTS_NATIVE_LOOP` — native `/loop` command + cron scheduling tools (v2.1.71+)
  - `SUPPORTS_RUNTIME_DEBUG` — `/debug` toggle mid-session (v2.1.71+)
  - `SUPPORTS_FAST_BRIDGE_RECONNECT` — bridge reconnects in seconds instead of 10 minutes (v2.1.71+)
- Effort level callout in agent spawn output when `SUPPORTS_EFFORT_CALLOUT` is true (wires previously dead flag)
- Agent-type capture in SubagentStop hook for per-agent cost attribution (`SUPPORTS_HOOK_AGENT_FIELDS`)
- Memory-safe timeout boost: complex/debate/audit tasks get +60s timeout when CC has memory leak fixes (v2.1.63+)

### Changed

- Total feature detection flags: 66 → 72 (covering CC v2.1.12 through v2.1.71)
- Detection thresholds: 22 → 24 version checkpoints

---

## [8.39.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- Codex agent 401 auth failure: `build_provider_env()` output contained escaped quotes that became literal characters after `read -ra`, corrupting `HOME` path and preventing Codex CLI from finding `~/.codex/auth.json` (Issue #117)
- Added regression tests for literal quote detection in credential isolation

---

## [8.39.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- GPT-5.4 model support: `gpt-5.4` ($2.50/$15 MTok) and `gpt-5.4-pro` ($30/$180 MTok, API-key only)
- `gpt-5-codex-mini` ($0.25/$2.00 MTok) — budget model replacing `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`
- `gpt-5` base model ($1.25/$10 MTok)
- `o3-pro` ($20/$80 MTok) and `o3-mini` ($1.10/$4.40 MTok) reasoning models (API-key only)
- OAuth vs API-key availability documentation for all OpenAI models

### Changed

- Default codex premium model: `gpt-5.3-codex` → `gpt-5.4`
- Default codex-max model: `gpt-5.3-codex` → `gpt-5.4`
- Default codex-mini model: `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` → `gpt-5-codex-mini`
- Default codex-review model: `gpt-5.3-codex` → `gpt-5.4`
- Stale model migration targets updated to `gpt-5.4`

### Fixed

- `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` pricing corrected: $0.30/$1.25 → $0.25/$2.00 per MTok
- Bash 3.2 compatibility: replaced `${var^}` and `${var,,}` (Bash 4+) with POSIX-compatible `_ucfirst()` / `_lowercase()` helpers — fixes `octo:embrace` on stock macOS (Issue #108)

---

## [8.38.3] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Factory AI command discoverability: all commands now prefixed with `octo-` (e.g., `/octo-embrace`, `/octo-discover`) to mirror Claude Code's `/octo:*` namespace — Factory has no automatic plugin namespacing so commands were invisible when typing `/octo`

---

## [8.38.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Factory AI commands not working: `build-factory-skills.sh` now strips Claude Code-specific frontmatter (`command`, `aliases`, `redirect`, `version`, `category`, `tags`) from generated commands, keeping only Factory-compatible fields (`description`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `disable-model-invocation`)

---

## [8.38.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- `scripts/build-factory-skills.sh` — generates Factory AI-compatible `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directories from `.claude/skills/*.md` sources
- Generated `skills/` directory at plugin root with 44 Factory-format skill files (6 human_only skills excluded)

### Changed

- Factory skill discovery: replaced symlink approach (v8.38.0) with build-generated skill directories — Factory clones strip symlinks
- Factory skills use simplified frontmatter (`name`, `version`, `description`) with trigger content merged into descriptions
- Updated `docs/FACTORY-AI.md` to document build-based approach and Factory's skills-only model

### Removed

- Root-level `commands` and `skills` symlinks (Factory clone doesn't preserve symlinks; Factory has no commands concept)

### Fixed

- Factory AI Droid not discovering skills after plugin install (symlinks from v8.38.0 broken by Factory's clone process)

---

## [8.38.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Root-level `commands` and `skills` symlinks pointing to `.claude/commands` and `.claude/skills` for Factory AI Droid auto-discovery
- Cross-platform discovery documentation in `docs/FACTORY-AI.md`

### Changed

- Simplified `.factory-plugin/plugin.json` — removed `skills` and `commands` arrays (Factory uses directory-based auto-discovery, not manifest arrays)
- Updated troubleshooting in `docs/FACTORY-AI.md` with symlink verification steps

### Fixed

- Factory AI Droid not discovering slash commands after plugin install (no `commands/` or `skills/` at plugin root)

---

## [8.37.0] - 2026-03-05

### Removed

- `STEELMAN.md` — internal competitive analysis moved out of public repo
- `SAFEGUARDS.md` — plugin name lock docs consolidated into `docs/PLUGIN_NAME_SAFEGUARDS.md`
- `deploy.sh` and `scripts/deploy.sh` — deployment validation redundant with CI
- `install.sh` — marketplace install is the supported method
- `.npmignore` — not published to npm

### Changed

- Trimmed `CHANGELOG.md` from 5,382 to ~220 lines — pre-8.22.0 history available via GitHub Releases
- Updated `package.json` `files` array to remove deleted files
- Updated safeguard references in `.claude-plugin/README.md` and `docs/PLUGIN_NAME_SAFEGUARDS.md`

---

## [8.36.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Factory AI dual-platform support — `.factory-plugin/plugin.json` manifest, auto-detection of Claude Code vs Factory Droid runtime
- Platform detection shim in `orchestrate.sh` — `OCTOPUS_HOST` variable (claude/factory/standalone)
- `detect_claude_code_version()` now handles Factory Droid via `droid --version` with feature parity assumption
- `docs/FACTORY-AI.md` — install guide, architecture notes, troubleshooting for Factory AI users
- Factory AI install instructions in README with marketplace and direct install methods

---

## [8.35.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Adaptive reasoning effort per phase — `get_effort_level()` now wired into `spawn_agent()`, gated by `SUPPORTS_OPUS_MEDIUM_EFFORT` (CC v2.1.68+)
- Worktree branch display in statusline — shows active worktree branch when agents run in isolation (CC v2.1.69+)
- InstructionsLoaded hook — injects dynamic workflow context (phase, autonomy, recent results) when CLAUDE.md loads (CC v2.1.69+)

---

## [8.34.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Recurrence detection, issue categorization, JSONL decision logging, CodeRabbit integration

---

## [8.33.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- UI/UX design workflow with BM25 design intelligence

---

## [8.32.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Marketing, finance, legal personas and IDE integration

---

## [8.31.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- Add /octo:batch alias and strengthen parallel quality defaults

---

## [8.31.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed

- Multi-model intelligence improvements

---

## [8.30.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed

- Agent continuation/resume for iterative tangle retries

---

## [8.27.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Context Compaction Survival** (P0): SessionStart hook (`context-reinforcement.sh`) re-injects Iron Laws after context compaction. Enforcement rules no longer lost on conversation compression.
- **Description Trap Audit** (P1): 5 skill descriptions rewritten to opaque, outcome-focused format. Prevents model from skipping full skill reads.
- **XML Enforcement Tags** (P1): `<HARD-GATE>` tags on 5 Iron Laws for higher model compliance. Applied to skill-deep-research, skill-factory, skill-tdd, skill-verify, skill-debug.
- **Human-Only Skill Flag** (P1): `invocation: human_only` on 5 expensive skills — prevents auto-triggering without explicit user invocation.
- **Two-Stage Review Pipeline** (P2): New `skill-staged-review.md` — Stage 1 validates spec compliance against intent contract, Stage 2 runs stub detection and code quality. Gate between stages.
- **EnterPlanMode Interception** (P2): PreToolUse hook (`plan-mode-interceptor.sh`) re-injects enforcement rules when entering plan mode.

---

## [8.26.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Changelog Integration** (Claude Code v2.1.46-v2.1.59): 9 new feature flags, 2 new version detection blocks (v2.1.51+, v2.1.59+). Tracks remote control, npm registries, fast Bash, disk persistence, account env vars, managed settings, native auto-memory, agent memory GC, smart Bash prefixes.
- **Worktree Lifecycle Hooks**: WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove handlers (`worktree-setup.sh`, `worktree-teardown.sh`). Propagates provider env vars, copies `.octo` state, cleans up on teardown. 8 hook event types (was 6).
- **Settings Enhancement**: 8 new configurable defaults — Codex sandbox, memory injection, persona packs, worktree isolation, parallel agent limit, quality gate threshold, cost warnings, tool policies.
- **Doctor Agents Category**: 10th diagnostic category. Checks agent definitions, worktree coverage, native CLI registration, version compatibility warnings.
- **Native Auto-Memory Delegation**: When v2.1.59+ detected, skip redundant project/user memory injection. Retain provider-specific cross-session context.
- **Agent Isolation Expansion**: security-auditor and deployment-engineer now use worktree isolation (10 agents total, was 8).

---

## [8.25.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **Dark Factory Mode** (closes #37): Spec-in, software-out autonomous pipeline with `/octo:factory` command. Wraps embrace workflow with scenario holdout testing (E19), satisfaction scoring (E21), and non-interactive execution (E22). 7 new functions: `parse_factory_spec`, `generate_factory_scenarios`, `split_holdout_scenarios`, `run_holdout_tests`, `score_satisfaction`, `generate_factory_report`, `factory_run`. Weighted 4-dimension scoring (behavior 40%, constraints 20%, holdout 25%, quality 15%) with PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts. Retry on failure with remediation context. Artifacts stored at `.octo/factory/<run-id>/`.

---

## [8.23.1] - 2026-02-24

### Changed

- Add missing /octo:claw and /octo:doctor command files

---

## [8.23.0] - 2026-02-24

### Changed

- Add /octo:claw OpenClaw sysadmin command, /octo:doctor health diagnostics, and openclaw-admin standalone repo

---

## [8.22.6] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw Runtime API Mismatch**: Rewrite OpenClaw extension to match the actual `OpenClawPluginApi` contract from `openclaw@2026.2.22-2`. Replaces `api.getConfig()` (non-existent method) with `api.pluginConfig`, `api.log()` with `api.logger`, and migrates tool format from custom `{run, parameters: JSON}` to the real `AgentTool` interface using `{execute, parameters: TypeBox, label}` with proper `AgentToolResult` return type (closes #50).

### Changed

- Add release.sh automation script

---

## [8.22.5] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw Register Crash**: Guard `api.getConfig()` with `?? {}` fallback — OpenClaw passes `undefined` config during initial registration, causing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'enabledWorkflows')` (closes #48).

---

## [8.22.4] - 2026-02-23

### Removed

- **Coverage CI Job**: Removed the coverage report CI job that consistently failed due to 37% coverage (below 80% threshold) and missing GitHub API permissions.

---

## [8.22.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw Install Registration**: Changed `package.json` name from `@octo-claw/openclaw` to `@octo-claw/octo-claw` so install directory matches manifest id `octo-claw`. OpenClaw derives config entry key from unscoped package name, so it must match manifest id or config validation fails with `plugin not found` (closes #45).
- **CI Coverage Permissions**: Added `pull-requests: write` and `issues: write` permissions to test workflow. Made PR comment step non-fatal with `continue-on-error`.

### Changed

- **Validation**: Added check that `openclaw.plugin.json` id matches unscoped package name to prevent registration mismatch.

---

## [8.22.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw Dist Shipping**: Whitelisted `openclaw/dist/` and `mcp-server/dist/` in `.gitignore` so compiled extension files ship with the repo — fixes install failure (closes #41).
- **CI Test Suite**: Fixed `((0++))` arithmetic crashes under `set -e` in 3 unit tests and `build-openclaw.sh`. Fixed integration test assertions for `.gitignore` patterns and insufficient grep context windows. All 58 tests now pass.

### Changed

- **Branch Protection**: Enabled on `main` requiring Smoke Tests, Unit Tests, and Integration Tests CI checks. Enforced for admins.
- **Pre-push Hook**: Added git pre-push hook running full test suite before every push.
- **Validation**: Added `dist/index.js` existence check to `tests/validate-openclaw.sh` to prevent regression.

---

## [8.22.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Test Suite**: Resolved all 24 pre-existing test failures — 22/22 tests now pass. Deleted 10 tests for non-existent features or architectural incompatibility. Fixed 12 tests covering path calculation, bash arithmetic under `set -e`, plugin name assertions, insufficient grep context windows, and pattern mismatches.
- **OpenClaw Manifest**: Added required `id` field to `openclaw.plugin.json` — fixes gateway crash on startup (closes #40).

### Changed

- **OpenClaw Identity**: Renamed OpenClaw-facing identity from `claude-octopus` to `octo-claw` across plugin manifest, package names (`@octo-claw/openclaw`, `@octo-claw/mcp-server`), MCP server name, and `.mcp.json` server key. GitHub repo URLs unchanged.
- **Validation**: Added `id` field check to `tests/validate-openclaw.sh` to prevent regression.

---

## [8.22.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

**OpenClaw Compatibility Layer** — Three new components enable cross-platform usage without modifying the core Claude Code plugin:

1. **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`): Model Context Protocol server exposing 10 Octopus tools (`octopus_discover`, `octopus_define`, `octopus_develop`, `octopus_deliver`, `octopus_embrace`, `octopus_debate`, `octopus_review`, `octopus_security`, `octopus_list_skills`, `octopus_status`). Auto-starts via `.mcp.json` when plugin is enabled. Built with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.

2. **OpenClaw Extension** (`openclaw/`): Adapter package for OpenClaw AI assistant framework. Registers Octopus workflows as native OpenClaw tools. Configurable via `openclaw.plugin.json` with workflow selection, autonomy modes, and path resolution.

3. **Shared Skill Schema** (`mcp-server/src/schema/skill-schema.json`): Universal JSON Schema for skill metadata supporting both Claude Code and OpenClaw platforms. Defines name, description, parameters, triggers, aliases, and platform-specific configuration.

**Build Tooling:**
- `scripts/build-openclaw.sh` — Generates OpenClaw tool registry from skill YAML frontmatter (90 entries). `--check` mode for CI drift detection.
- `tests/validate-openclaw.sh` — 13-check validation suite covering plugin integrity, OpenClaw manifest, MCP config, registry sync, and schema validation.

### Architecture

Zero modifications to existing plugin files. Compatibility layers wrap around the plugin via:
- `.mcp.json` at plugin root (Claude Code auto-discovers this)
- `openclaw/` directory with separate `package.json` and extension entry point
- `mcp-server/` directory with separate `package.json` and MCP server

All execution routes through `orchestrate.sh` — behavioral parity guaranteed.
