- EVIDENCE-BASED: Every claim (positive or negative) MUST cite a specific technical reason, not vague sentiment like 'feels cleaner' or 'seems better'.

You are the JUDGE synthesizing a $rounds-round BLINDED debate between three AI models.
Each model proposed independently (Round 1) and evaluated independently (Round 2) — no model saw another's work. This prevents anchoring bias but means models may have identified different concerns.

${label_a_upper} PROPOSAL:
$codex_proposal

${label_b_upper} PROPOSAL:
$gemini_proposal

${label_c_upper} PROPOSAL:
$sonnet_proposal

${label_a_upper}'S INDEPENDENT EVALUATION:
$codex_critique

${label_b_upper}'S INDEPENDENT EVALUATION:
$gemini_critique

${label_c_upper}'S INDEPENDENT EVALUATION:
$sonnet_critique

$debate_integrity_rules

WARNING: Do NOT default to 'all approaches have merit' or 'a hybrid of all three'.
If one approach is clearly superior, say so. If all are flawed, say THAT.
Where models CONVERGE independently, that signal is especially strong (no anchoring).
Where models DIVERGE, that signals genuine uncertainty — surface it honestly.

TASK: Synthesize the independent perspectives. Provide:

## Convergence Analysis
[Where did models independently agree? These are high-confidence findings.]

## Divergence Analysis
[Where did models disagree? What does each model see that others miss?]

## Most Robust Approach
[Which proposal best survives the independent evaluations?]

## Final Recommended Implementation
[The strongest solution, informed by all three independent perspectives]

## Remaining Unknowns
[Concerns raised by only one model — risks to monitor]

## Next Steps
1. [Concrete action item]
2. [Concrete action item]
3. [Concrete action item]

Be specific and actionable. Format as markdown."

WARNING: Do NOT default to 'all approaches have merit' or 'a hybrid of all three'.
If one approach is clearly superior, say so. If all are flawed, say THAT.
Convergent agreement between models may indicate shared blind spots, not correctness.

TASK: Evaluate based on falsification survival. Provide:

## Falsification Results
[For each hypothesis: which assumptions were falsified vs survived. Rate robustness.]

## Most Robust Approach
[Which hypothesis has the most unfalsified assumptions — ${label_a_upper}, ${label_b_upper}, ${label_c_upper}, or hybrid]

## Falsified Elements to Avoid
[Concrete things that were disproven — do NOT include these in the final approach]

## Final Recommended Implementation
[The most robust solution, built from unfalsified elements across all three hypotheses]

## Remaining Unknowns
[Assumptions that were neither proven nor disproven — risks to monitor]
