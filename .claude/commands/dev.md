# Dev Work Mode

## Implementation Instructions

When this command is executed:

1. **Check current mode:**
   - Config file: `.claude/claude-octopus.local.md`
   - If file doesn't exist, user is already in Dev Work Mode (default)
   - Use bash `test -f` to check existence before reading

2. **Switch to Dev Work mode:**
   - Create/update `.claude/claude-octopus.local.md` with YAML frontmatter
   - Set `knowledge_mode: false`
   - Confirm the switch with current mode details

3. **Show confirmation:**
   - Display Dev Work Mode emoji (🔧)
   - List active personas
   - Suggest available commands (octo build, octo review, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
/octo:dev        # Switch to Dev Work mode
```

   - For: Software development, code, technical tasks
